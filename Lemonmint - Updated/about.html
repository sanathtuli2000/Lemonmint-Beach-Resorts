      <h3>Motto</h3>
      <img src="images/home/04.jpg" width="280" alt="" />
      <p><strong>For Guest coming for the first time to Goa: 
The rich cultural heritage of Goa is a stark contrast to the rest of India. This is one quality that makes the culture of Goa truly unique. Goa is a place where you find people accepting the presence of all major religions without any ego or hesitation. This is the place where people follow tradition as well as remain ahead with time and trends. The Goan culture is very easy going and relaxed. You won't find people fighting or arguing over religious issues or dress codes. Everyone is free follow the kind of lifestyle they want to, unlike the rest of India where tradition and conservatism is an inseparable part of one's life.<br>
